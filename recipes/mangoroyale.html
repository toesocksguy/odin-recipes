    <h3>Description</h3>
    <p>One of the simplest mango desserts you can make - yet one of 
        the best. This Filipino classic frozen treat combines sweet, 
        juicy Manila mangoes with fluffy whipped cream, sweetened 
        condensed milk, and a nutty brown-butter graham cracker crust. </p>
    <h3>Ingredients</h3>
    <p>
        <h4>Equipment</h4>
        <ul>
            <li>9-inch pie plate</li>
            <li>Nonstick cooking spray</li>
            <li>Parchment paper</li>
        </ul>
        <h4>Ingredients</h4>
        <ul>
            <li>5 1/2 oz butter</li>
            <li>2 cups graham cracker crumbs</li>
            <li>25 oz very ripe manila mango flesh</li>
            <li>1 Tbsp lime juice</li>
            <li>4 1/2 oz sweetned condensed milk</li>
            <li>1 1/2 cups whipping cream</li>
        </ul>
    </p>
    <p>
        <h4>Steps</h4>
        <ol>
            <li>Spray the pie plate with non-stick spray, and 
                if you want you can line bottom with 
                parchment. (The parchment isn't totally 
                necessary but it does make it easier to remove.)</li>
            <li><strong>For the brown butter graham crust</strong>
                , place the graham cracker crumbs into a large mixing bowl.</li>
            <li>Brown the butter by melting it in a stainless 
                steel pot or skillet over medium heat. Once 
                melted, keep stirring until the butter becomes 
                very dark brown and looks almost burnt, about 
                5 minutes. Remove from the heat. 
                <em>(Note: There will be a lot of foam on top 
                    of the melted butter, this is normal, 
                    but if you keep stirring you will be able 
                    to see the colour of the butter through 
                    the foam.)</em></li>
            <li>Pour the brown butter over the graham crumbs 
                and mix well.</li>
            <li>Put about ⅔ of the graham crumbs into the pie 
                plate and spread it around, then press the 
                crumbs up the sides of the plate making them a 
                little less than ¼ inch thick. Then press them 
                into the bottom of the pie plate firmly. You 
                can take more of the reserved crumbs to fill 
                the crust as needed, as it's most important 
                that you have an even, sturdy bottom crust. 
                Chill the crust in the fridge while you make 
                the filling.</li>
            <li><strong>For the mango filling:</strong>
                Slice mango cheeks off the fruit, then use a 
                paring knife to score the flesh into ½-inch 
                cubes and use a spoon to scoop them out into a 
                large mixing bowl. You can remove the flesh 
                around the seeds, or just snack on them - as 
                long as you have at least 700 g (25 oz) of 
                flesh. </li>
            <li>Use a gloved hand to squish the mangoes until 
                it looks like a chunky mango sauce (about 
                half chunks half puree). Taste, then add 
                lime juice if it feels like it could use a 
                little extra acidity.</li>
            <li><strong>For the condensed whip:</strong>
                Combine condensed milk and cold whipping cream 
                in a medium mixing bowl and use a hand mixer 
                to beat them on medium to medium-low speed 
                until firm peaks form. To check for doneness, 
                lift your beater, and whatever sticks to your 
                beater should be able to hold its shape 
                against gravity with gentle shaking. Be 
                careful not to over-whip; once your beater 
                starts leaving clear trails you're almost 
                there, so pay attention and check often.</li>
            <li><strong>Build the pie:</strong>The layers are 
                built in this order: cream -> mango -> crumbs 
                -> cream -> mango -> crumbs.<br>
                Spread about half of the cream into the 
                chilled crust, then spoon half of the mangoes 
                over the cream, followed by about half of the 
                remaining crumbs. Repeat the layers with the 
                remaining filling, and if you don't end up 
                using everything, that's fine. You can use 
                whatever's left to make a mini version. </li>
            <li><strong>Freeze</strong> overnight (at least 8 
                hours), then allow to thaw for 1 hour at room 
                temp or thaw in the fridge overnight before 
                serving. If your schedule will allow, you can 
                also serve it after 5-6 hours of freezing. 
                Essentially you want to serve it semi-frozen 
                or partially thawed.</li>
            <br>
            <em><strong>Tip:</strong> If freezing for more than 1 night, to prevent 
                it from drying out and absorbing freezer smell I 
                recommend covering it with a double layer of 
                plastic wrap after the exterior has firmed up.</em>
