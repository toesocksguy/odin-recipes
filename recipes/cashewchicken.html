            <li>2 green onions, halved and thinly sliced</li>
        </ul>
        <h4>Sauce</h4>
        <ul>
            <li>1 Tbsp oyster sauce</li>
            <li>1 Tbsp soy</li>
            <li>1 tsp Golden Mountain sauce</li>
            <li>1 tsp fish sauce</li>
            <li>1 1/2 tsp sugar</li>
            <li>1 1/2 Tbsp Thai chili paste</li>
            <li>1 tsp toasted sesame oil</li>
        </ul>
    </p>
    <p>
        <h4>Steps</h4>
        <ol>
            <li><strong>For the cashews:</strong> Preheat the oven to 350°F (175°C) 
                and roast the cashews (yes even if you bought them 
                roasted, roast them again) on a baking sheet for 
                8-10 minutes, and until they darken in color. If 
                starting with raw cashews, roast them for 10-12 
                minutes, stirring them half way through for more 
                even roasting, until they are slightly darker than 
                golden.</li>
            <li>Combine the chicken thigh with soy sauce and mix well. 
                If using chicken breast, add 1 ½ Tbsp of water in 
                addition to the soy sauce. In either case let it sit 
                for at least 15 minutes.</li>
            <li>Combine all sauce ingredients in a small bowl.</li>
            <li>If using dried chilies, add the oil to a wok and add 
                the dried chilies; turn the heat on to low. 
                Keep stirring the chilies until they puff and 
                darken into a maroon colour, about 1 minute. 
                Quickly remove them with a mesh skimmer, leaving 
                the oil behind, and place them onto a paper towel 
                lined plate to drain.</li>
            <li>In the same wok, turn the heat up to high. Once the 
                oil is very hot, add the chicken and spread the 
                pieces out into one layer as much as you can.
                <br>Allow the chicken to sear, undisturbed, for about 
                2 minutes or until the underside is nicely browned. 
                Once browned, toss the chicken, and keep cooking, 
                stirring frequently, until the chicken is completely 
                cooked. Turn off the heat and remove the chicken from 
                the pan, leaving all the oil behind.</li>
            <li>With the heat still off, add the chopped garlic, 
                then turn the heat on to medium. Stir the garlic 
                until the smallest pieces turn golden, then add the 
                onions and stir for about one minute.</li>
            <li>Turn the heat up to high then add the bell peppers, 
                the chicken, and the sauce mixture and toss until 
                heated through and well mixed, about 1 minute.</li>
            <li>Turn off the heat, then add the green onions and 
                cashews and toss just until mixed. Plate and top 
                with fried chilies, and serve immediately with 
                jasmine rice. </li>
            <br>
            <em><strong>Note:</strong> Cashews should only be added right before 
                serving to maintain crunch. Trust me, soggy cashews 
                are NOT good! So if you’re making more of this recipe 
                than you can finish today, set aside what you won’t 
                eat before adding the cashews.</em>
