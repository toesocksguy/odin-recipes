    <h3>Description</h3>
    <p class="description">Homemade pad thai sauce is miles better than anything 
        you can buy, and with none of the additives. Using 
        only a few simple ingredients, you'll have this ready 
        to go for a quick weeknight pad thai! This recipe is 
        gluten-free, also check out my vegan pad thai recipe.</p>

        <h4>Steps</h4>
        <ol>
            <li>In a medium sized pot, heat the oil over 
                medium high heat. Add the garlic and shallots, 
                and saute until soft and translucent - about 
                5-8 minutes. Remove from the pot.</li>
            <li>Return the pot to the stove over medium heat, 
                then add the palm sugar and let it cook until 
                it melts; pressing on any hard chunks to help 
                them dissolve more quickly. After it melts, 
                let it cook a little further until it 
                caramelizes into a slightly darker brown for a 
                richer flavour, being careful not to let it 
                get too dark.</li>
            <li>Turn off the heat then add the tamarind paste; 
                it will bubble aggressively and the sugar will 
                harden initially. Turn the heat back on to low 
                to help the sugar dissolve and add the fish 
                sauce. Turn off the heat after the sugar is 
                mostly dissolved; don't worry about a few 
                chunks left over, they will dissolve eventually.</li>
            <li>Stir the garlic and shallots back in and let 
                cool. You can also add the chili flakes at 
                this stage if you wish to make it spicy.</li>
            <li>Measure the volume of the sauce by pouring it 
                into a liquid measuring cup. Divide the volume 
                by 8 to get the amount of sauce you need per 
                serving (if using my pad thai recipe). 
                Write this number down and tape it to the 
                container of the sauce, <strong>also note on the label 
                that you need to add 1 Â½ Tbsp of water per 
                serving when you cook.</strong></li>
        </ol>
